In this project, you will arrange Tetriminos among them and determine the smallest square that can fit all of them.</i>

This was a group project with <a href="https://github.com/easternfum">@easternfum</a>. This project was quite challenging for me as I was not super familiar with structs and arrays-inside-a-struct. I learned how to utilize them and I became quite comfortable with them now!
