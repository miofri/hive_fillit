Description:<br>
<i>Fillit is a project which involves discovering and getting acquainted with a recurrent problem in programming: the search of an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities in a reasonable amount of time. In this project, you will arrange Tetriminos among them and determine the smallest square that can fit all of them.</i>

This was a group project with <a href="https://github.com/easternfum">@easternfum</a>. This project was quite challenging for me as I was not super familiar with structs and arrays-inside-a-struct. I learned how to utilize them and I became quite comfortable with them now!
